# SortedFileTransfer

## What is this and why do I need it?
SortedFileTransfer is a JavaFX-based application for copying files in alphabetical order. Most other copying opportunities do not copy the files in aphabetical order even they are sorted by name. The copying order becomes relevant when using (embededded) systems which always sort by date like some car hifi systems do.

## How to use it
1. Download the executable JAR-release.
2. Try to execute it by double-clicking:
  * It worked? Great, happy copying!
  * It did not start?
    * Check if Java(TM) is installed, if not: install it
    * Check if Java(TM) is in your executable path (PATH variable), if not: add it
    * Happy Copying!
